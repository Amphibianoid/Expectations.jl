For example, it is recommended to be careful when using these methods for the following classes of functions and situations: \n\n\n\n\nDiscontinuous or nondifferentiable functions (even if the function is a.e.-differentiable)\n\n\nPeriodic/oscillatory functions with a high frequency\n\n\nExtremely large numbers of quadrature nodes, which may lead to vanishingly small weights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nIf you would like to get in touch, please do one of the following:\n\n\n\n\nIssue requests: Open an issue on the \npackage repository\n with the tag \nfeature request\n.\n\n\nBugs: Same as above, but with the tag \nbug\n.\n\n\nPull Request: We are always open to new functionality. If you have a feature you'd like to add (say, a new distribution or algorithm), once you prepare a PR with the feature and some tests, open it in the usual way.\n\n\nOther: You can reach out to Jesse Perla at \njesse.perla@ubc.ca\n and Arnav Sood at \narnav.sood@ubc.ca\n\n\nCitation: If this package was helpful in your research work, you may consider citing the package in whatever method is appropriate for your field.",
