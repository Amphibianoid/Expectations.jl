# Expectations

This is a WIP package designed to help with taking expectations of functions of random variables (i.e., defining an expectation operator `E` that could be applied `Ef(X)`). 

The underlying random variables are designed around the `Distributions.jl` interface. 

This implementation is designed around v0.6.
